Implement an application that accepts marks of 5 subjects and then prints the total and result (pass/fail/supplementary/pass with grace).

Subjects: DCF, UXD, DBMS, OOP, WA

Result: Pass/Fail/Supplementary

Min Marks: 0

Max Marks: 100

Min Passing Marks: 50

Criteria for passing: Less than 50 in zero subjects.

Criteria for failure: Less than 50 in more than one subject.

Criteria for Supplementary: Less than 50 in only one subject.

Print percentage and division

Criteria for division -

The percentage is >=70 : First Division

Percentage between >=60 and <70 : Second Division

Percentage between >=50 and <60 : Third Division

Suppose the student is failing in only one subject. In that one subject if the score is 47/48/49, then allot the required marks, change the score to 50, and print the result as a pass with the grace of  1/2/3 in the respective subject name.

Note: (i) Validations should be applied against data entered by the user.

           (ii) Percentage and division should be printed if the result is passed.

           (iii) In the case of grace,  division and percentage should not be mentioned.

Submission Guideline:

The student needs to submit a .cpp file and a pdf file as discussed in class.
